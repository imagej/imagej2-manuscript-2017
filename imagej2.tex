\parttitle{Background}
  ImageJ is an image analysis program extensively used in the biological
  sciences and beyond. Due to its ease of use, recordable macro language, and
  extensible plug-in architecture, ImageJ enjoys contributions from
  non-programmers, amateur programmers, and professional developers alike---a
  feat that arguably no other image analysis package, commercial or open
  source, has yet achieved. Enabling such a diversity of contributors has
  resulted in a unique community that spans the biological and physical
  sciences, making ImageJ an invaluable resource across countless disciplines.
  However, a rapidly growing user base, diverging plugin suites, and technical
  limitations have revealed a clear need for a concerted software engineering
  effort to support emerging imaging paradigms, to ensure the software's
  ability to handle the requirements of modern science.

\parttitle{Results}
  Our goal was ambitious: to create a future-proof tool without sacrificing the
  existing community. We rebuilt ImageJ from the ground up, engineering a
  powerful plugin mechanism that facilitates extensibility at every level. This
  next-generation ImageJ, called ``ImageJ2'' in places where the distinction
  matters, provides a host of new functionality. It separates concerns, fully
  decoupling the data model from the user interface. It emphasizes integration
  with external applications to maximize interoperability. Its robust new
  plugin framework allows everything from image formats, to scripting
  languages, to visualization to be extended by the community. The redesigned
  data model supports arbitrarily large, N-dimensional datasets, which are
  increasingly common in modern image acquisition. Despite the scope of these
  changes, backwards compatibility is maintained such that this new
  functionality can be seamlessly integrated with the classic ImageJ interface,
  allowing users and developers to migrate to these new methods at their own
  pace.

\parttitle{Conclusions}
  Scientific imaging benefits from open-source programs that advance new method
  development and deployment to a diverse audience. ImageJ has excelled in this
  regard; however, due to new and emerging challenges, it is at a critical
  development crossroads. The described improvements provide a framework
  adaptable to future needs, enabling continued success and innovation. Future
  efforts will focus on implementing new algorithms in this framework and
  expanding collaborations with other popular scientific software suites.

%% The Background section should be written in a way that is accessible to

\section*{Background}
Text for this section.

%% This should include a description of the overall architecture of the

\section*{Implementation}
Text for this section.

%% The user interface should be described and a discussion of the intended uses
%% of the software, and the benefits that are envisioned, should be included,
%% together with data on how its performance and functionality compare with,
%% and improve, on functionally similar existing software. A case study of the
%% use of the software may be presented. The planned future development of new
%% features, if any, should be mentioned.

\section*{Results and Discussion}
Text for this section.

%% This should state clearly the main conclusions and provide an explanation of
%% the importance and relevance of the case, data, opinion, database or
%% software reported.

\section*{Conclusions}
Text for this section.

%% If abbreviations are used in the text they should be defined in the text at
